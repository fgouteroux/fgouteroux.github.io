      <p>How far will your car go on “E”?</p>

<p>Once the little light pops on you know there’s a good bit left to get you to a fill-up at the nearest station.  And I’ve pushed my car knowing that. A bit of googling says depending on make &amp; model, most cars will get 30-50 miles.</p>

<p>But when the indicator light came on my bike this weekend I knew my little tank would <strong>not</strong> be so generous… or would it?
<!--more--></p>

<p>I started with one of my favorite roads to start my trip; Strackville Road. The road is only about 6 miles but it includes deep ruts, water crossing, and packed and loose rocks to navigate.  Its a great technical ride.</p>

<p>I had been back on tarmac for about 20 minutes when I turned onto Goldsmith rd, a class 3 packed gravel ride.  My indicator came on as soon as I straightened out.  Checking the map it was ~15 miles back to the last town, and ~10 miles to the next.  I knew the bike will get at least 15 miles on empty, so I pressed on.</p>

<p>County Road 26 was amazing, I wanted to really rev into some of these twisty turns, and stop at every other one to take a picture, but with my empty mileage counter growing I grew more nervous with every twist that only revealed more road.

<p>Where CR26 ended was popular state road, but the town was a miss. Checking the map again, and searching for gas stations my heart dropped atleast another 12 miles in the wrong direction. Heading home there was one about 20 miles out.</p>

<p>Optimism in heart I was optimistic this now major highway would have some little place that no one bothered to mark on my GPS.</p>

<p>… Well 35 miles on empty now, I must be running on fumes.  I’m now scanning every house I pass (which are all to infrequent) for a lawn-mower, atv, or anything with a gas can I could beg for.</p>

<p><strong>43 miles on empty</strong> – and finally! a shop, oh now.. no pumps here. I let the clutch out again as I spot something in the corner of the little general store - a single hose hand-cranked gas pump!</p>

<p><img src="43miles.JPG" alt="43 miles on empty" /></p>

<p>Wait, WAIT, turn-around!  Was that in fact an old hand-pump – is it show or functional?  Do they actually have gas?!</p>

<p>No option but to try!</p>

<p>Cash only, hand-cranked spinning wheels quickly brought my tank to full again.  The anxiety of leaving my bike and walking lord knows how far fades, I can finally resume taking in the scenery, and gosh what a ride.</p>

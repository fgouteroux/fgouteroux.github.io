I am a **Platform Engineer and Automation Consultant** based in 🇫🇷 Paris, France, with **16 years of experience** in the tech industry, including **11 years specializing in automation and infrastructure**.

Throughout my career, I've worked across diverse environments—from large enterprises like Ingenico Group and BNP Paribas to innovative startups—helping teams build scalable, automated infrastructure solutions.

Currently, I focus on **observability and monitoring platforms**, building secure multi-tenant stacks using the Grafana ecosystem (Grafana Mimir, Loki, Prometheus). I'm passionate about **open-source software** and actively contribute to major projects including Grafana, Prometheus, and their related tools.

As a **developer**, I create practical automation tools using **<i class="devicon-go-plain devicon-go-original"></i> Golang** and **<i class="devicon-python-plain devicon-python-original"></i> Python**, including Terraform providers for Grafana Mimir and Loki, custom Prometheus exporters, and CLI tools that help teams work more efficiently. I believe in writing code that solves real problems and eliminates repetitive tasks.

My expertise spans the full spectrum of cloud-native technologies: **<i class="devicon-kubernetes-plain devicon-kubernetes-original"></i> Kubernetes**, **<i class="devicon-terraform-plain devicon-terraform-original"></i> Terraform**, infrastructure as code with **<i class="fas fa-robot"></i> Puppet** and **<i class="devicon-ansible-plain devicon-ansible-original"></i> Ansible**, and cloud platforms including **AWS** and **OpenStack**. I've designed and deployed many things from private clouds to large-scale data platforms using MapR, Hadoop, and Spark.

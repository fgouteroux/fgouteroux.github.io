# About Me

Hello! I have **16 years of experience** including **11 years in automation**. I worked on a variety of big and small companies since the beginning of my studies.

## Things about me:

- What's better than the rush of joy from learning and understanding something new?
- There is nothing more frustrating and annoying than starting the same thing twice: **Automation is the best answer**.
- I love developing modules, plugins, and micro apps regardless of the language like **Go**, **Python** or config manager tools like **Ansible** or **Puppet**.

**Top Skills:** Golang • Linux • Puppet • Kubernetes • Terraform
